## How to Present This Project to Recruiters

### 1. LinkedIn Post Template
```
🎯 Just completed a comprehensive Customer Churn Analysis project!

Analyzed 7,000+ telecom customers to identify why 26% were leaving the service.

🔍 Key Findings:
• Month-to-month contracts have 42% churn vs 3% for 2-year contracts
• Customers without tech support are 3x more likely to churn
• New customers (< 6 months) are at 54% risk

📊 Built a predictive model (81% accuracy, 0.85 AUC) to identify at-risk customers and created actionable retention strategies that could save $2.5M+ annually.

🛠️ Tech: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Jupyter

Open source on GitHub: [link to your repo]

Subject: Data Analyst Portfolio Project - Customer Churn Analysis

Hi [Recruiter Name],

I've recently completed a comprehensive customer churn analysis project that demonstrates my data analysis and Python skills.

The project includes:
✓ Exploratory Data Analysis of 7,000+ customers
✓ Statistical analysis identifying key churn drivers
✓ Interactive visualizations with Plotly
✓ Predictive ML model (81% accuracy)
✓ Business recommendations with ROI calculations

The full analysis is available on my GitHub: [your repo link]

I'd love to discuss how these skills could add value to your team.

Best regards,
Giorgio

## Common Interview Questions & Answers

### Q: "Walk me through your project"
**A:** "I analyzed 7,000 telecom customers to understand churn. First, I explored patterns in contract type, tenure, and services. Key finding: month-to-month contracts have 42% churn vs 3% for 2-year contracts. I then built a logistic regression model to predict churn with 81% accuracy. This enables the business to target retention efforts, potentially saving $2.5M+ annually."

### Q: "What was the biggest challenge?"
**A:** "The biggest challenge was understanding feature relationships. At first, I thought tenure and monthly charges were the key drivers, but analysis showed contract type was far more important. This taught me the importance of thorough EDA before jumping to conclusions."

### Q: "How would you improve this project?"
**A:** "Good question! Next steps would be:
1. Try ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost) for better predictions
2. Perform deeper cohort analysis by geography and service type
3. Build an automated monitoring dashboard for real-time churn scoring
4. Conduct A/B testing on retention campaigns
5. Incorporate customer feedback/sentiment data"

### Q: "How do you handle imbalanced data?"
**A:** "Great question! Churn is imbalanced (26% positive class). In this project, I focused on precision-recall and ROC-AUC rather than accuracy. In production, I'd consider:
- Stratified train-test split (which I used)
- SMOTE oversampling
- Class weight adjustment in the model
- Threshold tuning based on business cost"

### Q: "How would you deploy this model?"
**A:** "I'd build an API endpoint using Flask/FastAPI that:
1. Takes customer features as input
2. Returns churn probability score
3. Logs predictions for model monitoring
4. Updates daily with new customer data
5. Triggers alerts for high-risk customers"
